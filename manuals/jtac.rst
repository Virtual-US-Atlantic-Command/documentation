JTAC - "5 Line" Procedures
=========================================================================
Some ArmaFriday Combined Arms missions will include players in the sky in either fixed wing aircraft or attack helicopters. In order to facilitate efficient attacks, ArmaFriday uses a "5-line" system adopted from the real 9-line JTAC system to guide attacks at the appropriate targets.

=================================================
As a Close Air Support (CAS) Pilot
=================================================

Close Air Support - Will report in Area of Operations with the following:

* Callsign
* Type of Aircraft
* Relative Position to units on the field

 Example: "Hog 1-1, A10C Available for Tasking, 1 minute East from Novorsk"

=================================================
Requesting Air Support as JTAC
=================================================

Here's the "5-line" system to use on communicating with air assets as a JTAC:

1. Callsign
2. Target's General Position
3. Target Description
4. Ordanance Requested
5. Ingress / Egress Direction

(Optional): Remarks such as the location and distance of friendlies relative to target

Example 1: "Hog 1-1, This is Whiplash, Target East side of Novorsk, 2 Heavy armor, requesting GBU GBU. Ingress from the West."
Example 2 with Optional remarks:"Hog 1-1, this is Whiplash. Target east side of Novorsk, 2 Heavy armor, requesting GBU. Ingress from the West. Note: Tower 300m West of Target.
