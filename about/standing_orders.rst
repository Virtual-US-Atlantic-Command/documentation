Standing Orders
=========================================================================

These are the current standing orders for Arma Friday sessions that intend to make our behavior deviate from the otherwise ordinary.

ORDER I: Scavenging Prohibition
"""""""""""""""""
In order to provide an ongoing challenge to players, fireteam leaders and squad leaders alike, all players will refrain from picking up equipment off of enemy or friendly corpses unless it is ammo or equipment that goes with the weapon and loadout they started with. The reasoning behind this rule is that we want to end up in situations where our ammo supply becomes scarce. The intent is for the ammo bearer role to remain relevant. And for the AT role to be the only one to resolve the AT problem. Keep track of your ammo situation and ask your team members for supplies. The FTL / SL will call in a supply drop if neccesary.

The only exclusion to this role is the AT role, who may pick up an enemy RPG if an attack is immiment and supplies are depleted.
