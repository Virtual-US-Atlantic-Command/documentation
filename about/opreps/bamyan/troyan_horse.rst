Mission Details
=================================================
Its finally November. It seems like fall was skipped this year and winter has finally come. A cold front is causing low cloud cover and foggy weather. We must use this sudden turn in the region's weather to our advantage. We've assemled a special unit for a high risk operation. Pay attention because the details are important. Our mission is to extract NATO POW's from a Russian base, plant charges and then perform hit and run attacks on the base. Here's how: you will be inserted by helicopter at location "Insertion". Its likely this will cause a bleep on the radar and they will send a helicopter out for reconnaisance. The weather will create a low visibility for air units but prevent beeing spotted at all costs. There may be patrols between you and location "Checkpoint". Location "Checkpoint" houses a russian fireteam whose objective it is to inspect all transport vehicles coming into the area. Take this guard post out and avoid a long firefight. A defector will have stashed away crates with uniforms and weapons in the ruined house at location "Checkpoint". Use the stashed equipment to disguise yourself as a Russian checkpoint and continue to perform routine checks on any enemy vehicles moving into the area. Make sure any troops not in disguise are hidden away. Intel suggests that at some point a troop transport vehicle will pass through the checkpoint. They had a long drive behind them, wait for them to get out to take a stroll and neutralize them, leaving the vehicle intact. There will be papers (not really) indicating this troop transport was meant to move the POW's out of the area. Assume control of this troop transport and infiltrate the base in the east. Assertain the location of the POW's and load them into the troop transport. Plant demolition charges at any site you deem strategic for your attack later but do not get caught. Move the POW's to the LZ "Extract" location and call in a chopper (Zeus) for extraction. Protect the LZ. Load the POW's into the helicopter. After the POW's are extracted, synchronize your hit and run attacks on the base with your demolition explosions. At your own perogative, move away from the base for extraction at a location of your choosing, just make sure its safe.

Feedback
=================================================

We pushed the game mechanics to the limit and were not able to pull off all gameplay elements tonight without glitches or breaking immersion:

* Couldn't get the whole team into a single URAL truck for some reason
* People kept caughing even though the storm had ended
* People couldn't put on enemy uniforms
* Zeus placed bases were not visible on the map. making coordination between teams difficult
* AI helicopters performing akwardly when near enemy units (pro tip: use careless mode)
* Difficult as Zeus to supply the team with weapons and ammo that doesn't make everyone go crazy unrealistic
