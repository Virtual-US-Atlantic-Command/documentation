Mission Details
=================================================
You are a member of a rapid response team. You've been deployed to the Tanoan Islands in the pacific for a 6 month rotation. You're about 3 months into your deployment and you're having a good time. Tanoa might as well be Hawaii. Its just another strategic location in the Pacific with civilians and a few military bases. Calm beaches and sunshine. Until this morning, when an automatic alarm calls you to action for a rapid response to a reseach facility you didn't even know was there in the first place. Better go check it out.
