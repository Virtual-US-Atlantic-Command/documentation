Mission Details
=================================================

Panthera just suffered from a famine and tense political discourse during its elections. Recovery has been slow but the countryside has been left behind the most. ArmaFriday is providing Support to a UN peacekeeping operation providing food to the more rural areas.

We later learned a character referred to as "Le General" had run the country for many years and figured he would consolidate his political power by having himself be "elected" democratically. This move turned on him however and he was voted out. A more pro-western revolutionary taking his place. This made Panthera very devided between the North-East and the South-East.



Execution..
"""""""""""""""""
The bananas from Tanoa were delivered successfully, but a patrol if silver helmeted troops were spotted to the North of town. After touching base with the local UN commander we learned that there was a probability "Le General" was hiding out in these mountains. Shortly after we were attacked from the South mountain ridge and we called in A-10C Close Air Support from Hog-1-1.

The enemy's attacks intensified however and soon we were beeing surrounded from all sides. The ArmaFriday platoon resorted to calling in a "Broken Arrow" after which command bombarded our location in the valley.

The enemy's attacks decreased in intesity after that and we continued to make our way back. We met heavy resistance trying to cross the bridge over which we originally came into the valley. But thanks to successfgul maneuvering using our Humvees as cover, we were able to break through and leave the mountains. Those mountains are heavily fortified by "Le General" and they probably use an extensive tunnel network. We must be weary and anticipate the General's next moves, or try and weaken his grip on Panthera.
