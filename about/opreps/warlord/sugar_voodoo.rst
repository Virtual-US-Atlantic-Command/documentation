Mission Details
=================================================

Move out from Georgetown and assault a sugar factory to the east which is believed to be used by the Russians to develop chemical weapons on Tanoa Island.


Execution..
"""""""""""""""""
After helicopter landing south of Georgetown we moved east under the cover of darkness. First enemy contact happened near a bridge. At daybreak we noticed Korde was missing which some of the team attritubed to "Voodoo". According to command Korde was taken away to the South East. We spend a good hour and a half resquing Korde. After a while we established radio contact and through referencing landmarks we were able to find each other.

**Assault on the sugar factory**

The assault on the sugar factory commenced from the West. We encountered two fireteams guarding the eastern perimeter which we took out. Moving further west we encountered heavy resistance due to multiple squads guarding the sugar factory. We tried to breach their defences through the center, but a decision was made to swing around North and approach the sugar factory from the Northern flank which offered a lot more cover.

We made it about mid-way there before needing to do a tactical retreat and re-supply. During our second wave we called in artillery support allowing us to push through and secure the sugar factory.

We confired during our assault the factory was indeed repurposed for the production of chemical weapons.
