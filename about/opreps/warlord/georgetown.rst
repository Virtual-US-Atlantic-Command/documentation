Mission Details
=================================================

Johny's forces have consolidated in Georgetown and plan to invade Tavunaka Island. We intend to have the jump on him and take Johny out.


Execution..
"""""""""""""""""

We went in from the north through Saint-Julien. We encountered some patrol boats and took them out. Our progress towards Georgetown went smoothly. We encountered a lot of resistance leading into Georgetown at the bridge. Thanks to artillery support and CAS we managed to fight our way to Johny who was holding out at the radio tower. Johny drew a gun on Teo and Teo took the shot. Johny didn't make it. We continued south to 3 fuel tanks and blew those up. It is then the Russians came to Johny's aid but too late. We held our ground at the bridge which provided an excellent bottleneck. At some point the assault became too much for us to resist so we had an emergency extract back to base. No casualties. Minor wounded.
