Mission Details
=================================================
We're at the height of the Tanoan Island offensive during a lull in what is now a 4 day continious battle. Last night Allied forces were forced to retreat when a particularly intense lightning storm scattered most units across Tanoa and took out primary communications facilities. In the aftermath of the storm, you've come across other soldiers and formed an impromtu unit. Day is about to break in a couple of minutes. You have no idea where you are. You have no means of contacting command. All you know is that you're on an enemy occupied island. Your mission is to find a way to communicate with command, explain where you are and figure out a way to extract off the island. Watch out for enemy boobie traps and assume respawns are disabled.

Execution..

The guys headed south from their immediate location and secured some maps and intel indicating the long range radio could be found to the east. A helicopter was continiously scouting overhead looking for scattered troops. They got spotted several times which prompted the enemy to reinforce their current position. The enemy was also very successful boobie trapping the players multiple times by placing tripwire mines in between trees they were potentially going to go.

Eventually the team made it to Oumere and secure the radio after which they moved further south and crossed the bridge to rejoin with NATO forces.
