Why Arma Friday?
=========================================================================

=================================================
We share values & goals
=================================================

* We get a kick out of putting our team mates before ourselves. Its fun, especially when a teammate puts you before himself later. 
* We don't want to burn out. We only play every Friday and not more or less. It keeps us looking forward to the next run.
* Doing something together gives us a sense of ackomplishment.

Installation

Step 1: ARMA III Setup
"""""""""""""""""
Make sure you have ARMA III installed and the APEX DLC, as we use Tanoa and its assets quite often
