How to get started with Arma Friday
=========================================================================

The type of player you should be to fit in

* You are 18 years of age or older and a mature individual.
* You enjoy the feeling of being part of something bigger than just yourself.
* You are able to compromise.
* You've never been kicked from clans, guilds or other ARMA units.

=================================================
Installation
=================================================

Step 1: ARMA III Setup
"""""""""""""""""
Make sure you have ARMA III installed and the APEX DLC, as we use Tanoa and its assets quite often.


Step 2: Install our modlist
"""""""""""""""""
All of our mods are found in the steam workshop, make sure you are subscribed to all of the following mods:
* `TypicalPhineas ARMA Friday Modlist <http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=886075869>`_

Step 3: Install Teamspeak3
"""""""""""""""""
We use teamspeak 3 to facilitate our radio communications with the Task Force Radio mod. Make sure you have the `latest version of teamspeak3 <https://www.teamspeak.com/downloads.html>`_ installed as well.
 
Step 4: Install the Teamspeak 3 Task Force Radio plugin
"""""""""""""""""
Download the `latest version of task force radio <https://github.com/michail-nikolaev/task-force-arma-3-radio/releases/download/0.9.12/0.9.12.zip>`_  and:

* Extract the .zip archive
* Install the TFR Teamspeak Plugin by double-clicking the Plugin Installer in the @task_force_radio\teamspeak folder.
* We recommend using the "task_force_radio.ts3_plugin" only and don't use the "task_force_radio_3.1Compat.ts3_plugin"
* Make sure Caps Lock key is not used for talking in TeamSpeak
* Turn off voice over network (VON) in ARMA 3 or change key to different than Caps Lock (to avoid voice doubling).

Step 5: Make sure you are on the ArmaFriday discord server
"""""""""""""""""
Join the ARMA Friday discord server `here <https://discord.gg/KQa9ENf>`_  and look for the next ArmaFriday session in the #arma-signup text chat channel. There will be a link to a google form to sign-up for the next event.

Step 6: Join the ArmaFriday ARMAIII unit (optional)
"""""""""""""""""

Information you need to know
=================================================

Arma Friday is streamed by the `TypicalPhineas Twitch channel <https://www.twitch.tv/typicalphineas>`_. This comes with two implicit rules: We jest, joke around and have fun, but we keep our language PG-13. Phineas retains the perogative to remove any player from his stream. http://armafriday.com/#about

A brief outline of what ARMA Friday is and the kind of players we are looking for can be found on `armafriday.com <http://armafriday.com/#about>`_
